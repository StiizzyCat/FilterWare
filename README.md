### How it works?
This IP logger uses Ngrok and the ExpressJS framework and Replit.com, the victim clicks the forwarded link generated by Ngrok and you get their IP and information
This also requires an ngrok authtoken so you need to sign up [Sign Up instructions](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started)

### Features:
Port Forwarding Ngrok

## it is best to run this on repl so your ip is not exposed or u could use a vpn and run on windows
