### How it works?
This IP logger uses Ngrok and the ExpressJS framework, the victim clicks the forwarded link generated by Ngrok and you get their IP and information
This also requires an ngrok authtoken so you need to sign up [Sign Up instructions]([github.com/StiizzyCat](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started)  "Get Started")
